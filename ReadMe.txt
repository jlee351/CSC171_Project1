Project 1: WordWrap.java
Due Date: Sep 30, 2021
Name: Joon Hyup Lee

Compilation: Code compiles and runs without issues

1. Program has one class and is written all in one main method. 
2. Program takes in one integer from user, number of letters on one line, then however many blocks and/or lines of word.
3. Program stops taking user input after user types in Stop. on one separate line.
4. Program stores said words in an array (later discussed in Problems) and prints them accordingly to the number of letters previously give by user.


Problem:

1. Program currently works for all blocks of texts; however it creates one space whenever a new line is created. 

e.g.) 
EXPECTED OUTPUT:

Notice also how spaces are reduced, but blank lines remain.

Lastly, when there are 
superlongtokensthatarelongerthanmax 
notice how they’re on a single line.

Your program will read until 
it encounters Stop.

MY OUTPUT:

Notice also how spaces are reduced, but blank lines remain.

 Lastly, when there are 
superlongtokensthatarelongerthanmax 
notice how they’re on a single line.

it encounters Stop.

2. Program uses one array. Could not find method otherwise.
